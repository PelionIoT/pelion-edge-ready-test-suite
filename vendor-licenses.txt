# array-uniq [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sindresorhus/array-uniq.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sindresorhus/array-uniq)

> Create an array without duplicates

It's already pretty fast, but will be much faster when [Set](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set) becomes available in V8 (especially with large arrays).


## Install

```sh
$ npm install --save array-uniq
```


## Usage

```js
var arrayUniq = require('array-uniq');

arrayUniq([1, 1, 2, 3, 3]);
//=> [1, 2, 3]

arrayUniq(['foo', 'foo', 'bar', 'foo']);
//=> ['foo', 'bar']

The following NPM packages may be included in this product:

 - assert-plus@1.0.0

These packages each contain the following license and notice below:

# assert-plus

This library is a super small wrapper over node's assert module that has two
things: (1) the ability to disable assertions with the environment variable
NODE\_NDEBUG, and (2) some API wrappers for argument testing.  Like
`assert.string(myArg, 'myArg')`.  As a simple example, most of my code looks
like this:

```javascript
    var assert = require('assert-plus');

    function fooAccount(options, callback) {
        assert.object(options, 'options');
        assert.number(options.id, 'options.id');
        assert.bool(options.isManager, 'options.isManager');
        assert.string(options.name, 'options.name');
        assert.arrayOfString(options.email, 'options.email');
        assert.func(callback, 'callback');

        // Do stuff
        callback(null, {});
    }
```

# API

All methods that *aren't* part of node's core assert API are simply assumed to
take an argument, and then a string 'name' that's not a message; `AssertionError`
will be thrown if the assertion fails with a message like:

    AssertionError: foo (string) is required
    at test (/home/mark/work/foo/foo.js:3:9)
    at Object.<anonymous> (/home/mark/work/foo/foo.js:15:1)
    at Module._compile (module.js:446:26)
    at Object..js (module.js:464:10)
    at Module.load (module.js:353:31)
    at Function._load (module.js:311:12)
    at Array.0 (module.js:484:10)
    at EventEmitter._tickCallback (node.js:190:38)

from:

```javascript
    function test(foo) {
        assert.string(foo, 'foo');
    }
```

There you go.  You can check that arrays are of a homogeneous type with `Arrayof$Type`:

```javascript
    function test(foo) {
        assert.arrayOfString(foo, 'foo');
    }
```

You can assert IFF an argument is not `undefined` (i.e., an optional arg):

```javascript
    assert.optionalString(foo, 'foo');
```

Lastly, you can opt-out of assertion checking altogether by setting the
environment variable `NODE_NDEBUG=1`.  This is pseudo-useful if you have
lots of assertions, and don't want to pay `typeof ()` taxes to v8 in
production.  Be advised:  The standard functions re-exported from `assert` are
also disabled in assert-plus if NDEBUG is specified.  Using them directly from
the `assert` module avoids this behavior.

The complete list of APIs is:

* assert.array
* assert.bool
* assert.buffer
* assert.func
* assert.number
* assert.finite
* assert.object
* assert.string

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License.

If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:

Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

# Growl for nodejs
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tj/node-growl.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tj/node-growl)

Growl support for Nodejs. This is essentially a port of my [Ruby Growl Library](http://github.com/visionmedia/growl). Ubuntu/Linux support added thanks to [@niftylettuce](http://github.com/niftylettuce).

## Installation

### Install

### Mac OS X (Darwin):

  Install [growlnotify(1)](http://growl.info/extras.php#growlnotify). On OS X 10.8, Notification Center is supported using [terminal-notifier](https://github.com/alloy/terminal-notifier). To install:

    $ sudo gem install terminal-notifier

  Install [npm](http://npmjs.org/) and run:

    $ npm install growl

### Ubuntu (Linux):

  Install `notify-send` through the [libnotify-bin](http://packages.ubuntu.com/libnotify-bin) package:

    $ sudo apt-get install libnotify-bin

  Install [npm](http://npmjs.org/) and run:

    $ npm install growl

### Windows:

  Download and install [Growl for Windows](http://www.growlforwindows.com/gfw/default.aspx)

  Download [growlnotify](http://www.growlforwindows.com/gfw/help/growlnotify.aspx) - **IMPORTANT :** Unpack growlnotify to a folder that is present in your path!

  Install [npm](http://npmjs.org/) and run:

    $ npm install growl

## Examples

Callback functions are optional

```javascript
var growl = require('growl')
growl('You have mail!')
growl('5 new messages', { sticky: true })
growl('5 new emails', { title: 'Email Client', image: 'Safari', sticky: true })
growl('Message with title', { title: 'Title'})
growl('Set priority', { priority: 2 })
growl('Show Safari icon', { image: 'Safari' })
growl('Show icon', { image: 'path/to/icon.icns' })
growl('Show image', { image: 'path/to/my.image.png' })
growl('Show png filesystem icon', { image: 'png' })
growl('Show pdf filesystem icon', { image: 'article.pdf' })
growl('Show pdf filesystem icon', { image: 'article.pdf' }, function(err){
  // ... notified
})
```

## Options

  - title
    - notification title

    - application name
  - priority
    - priority for the notification (default is 0)
  - sticky

      - capitalized word sets --appIcon
      - filename uses extname as --icon
      - otherwise treated as --icon

      - appends message to end of shell command
      - or, replaces `%s` with message

# About

![Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/fkei/JSON.minify.png?branch=master)


# Feature

/*! JSON.minify()
	v0.1 (c) Kyle Simpson
	MIT License
*/

JSON.minify() minifies blocks of JSON-like content into valid JSON by removing all
whitespace *and* comments.

JSON parsers (like JavaScript's JSON.parse() parser) generally don't consider JSON
with comments to be valid and parseable. So, the intended usage is to minify
development-friendly JSON (with comments) to valid JSON before parsing, such as:

JSON.parse(JSON.minify(str));

Now you can maintain development-friendly JSON documents, but minify them before
parsing or before transmitting them over-the-wire.

Though comments are not officially part of the JSON standard, this post from
Douglas Crockford back in late 2005 helps explain the motivation behind this project.

http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/json/message/152

"A JSON encoder MUST NOT output comments. A JSON decoder MAY accept and ignore comments."

Basically, comments are not in the JSON *generation* standard, but that doesn't mean
that a parser can't be taught to ignore them. Which is exactly what JSON.minify()
is for.

The first implementation of JSON.minify() is in JavaScript, but the intent is to
port the implementation to as many other environments as possible/practical.

NOTE: As transmitting bloated (ie, with comments/whitespace) JSON would be wasteful
and silly, this JSON.minify() is intended for use in server-side processing
environments where you can strip comments/whitespace from JSON before parsing
a JSON document, or before transmitting such over-the-wire from server to browser.

[![semantic-release](https://img.shields.io/badge/%20%20%F0%9F%93%A6%F0%9F%9A%80-semantic--release-e10079.svg)](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release)

**node-environment-flags** is a *rough* polyfill and shim for [process.allowedNodeEnvironmentFlags](https://nodejs.org/api/process.html#process_process_allowednodeenvironmentflags), which was introduced in Node.js v10.10.0.

## Table of Contents

- [Install](#install)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [Maintainers](#maintainers)
- [Contribute](#contribute)
- [License](#license)

## Install

*Requires Node.js v6.0.0 or newer.*

```shell
$ npm i node-environment-flags
```

## Usage

If the current Node.js version is v10.10.0 or newer, the native implementation will be provided instead.

### As Polyfill (Recommended)

```js
const nodeEnvironmentFlags = require('node-environment-flags');

nodeEnvironmentFlags.has('--require'); // true
```

### As Shim

```js
require('node-environment-flags/shim')();

process.allowedNodeEnvironmentFlags.has('--require'); // true
```

## Notes

- This module approximates what `process.allowedNodeEnvironmentFlags` provides in versions of Node.js prior to v10.10.0.  Since `process.allowedNodeEnvironmentFlags` is based on [`NODE_OPTIONS`](https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html#cli_node_options_options) (introduced in v8.0.0), the set of supported flags for versions older than v8.0.0 is *highly theoretical*.
- Version ranges are matched using [semver](https://npm.im/semver).
- This module is granular to the *minor* Node.js version number; *patch* version numbers are not considered.
- Results for unmaintained (odd) versions of Node.js are based on data for the most recent LTS version; e.g., running this module against Node.js v7.10.0 will yield the same results as would v6.14.0.
- Prior art: @ljharb's [util.promisify](https://npm.im/util.promisify)

# Pelion Edge ready test suite

> deviceOS test automation suite

We designed the **Pelion Edge ready test suite** for testing the full working functionality of the deployed deviceOS builds and gateway software. The tests identify gaps, errors or functionality missing the required target. The test cases are divided into different levels according to the functional areas:

- Level 1: Validates files, folders, partition mounting, partition size and some hardware requirements.
- Level 2: Checks for the required programs and services on the gateway.
- Level 3: Checks for the network interface and connectivity.
- Level 4: Runs smoke and integration testcase to validate environment.
- Level 5: Checks all the process by running them one by one.
- Level 6: Runs protocol translator test cases.
- Level 7: Runs `facade_unit` tests to connectivity and controls.

The tests complete with three types of reports in CSV, JSON and XML JUnit.

## Features

With the Pelion Edge ready test suite, you can:

- Create test automation scripts.
- Choose test cases and levels.
- Run inside a physical gateway.
- Run a single test case or a group of test cases.
- Run the test suite on Linux machines with some changes in `config`.
- Configure the test suite using the `config`.

Other features include:

- Scalability.
- User- and business-friendly reporting.
- Configurable running order of test cases.
- Three types of reports (CSV, JSON, and XML).
- XML reports you can configure with Allure.
- Integration with Treasure Data and Redash.

## Platform

- deviceOS or Gateway Software.
- Ubuntu (Linux).

<span class="notes">**Note:** You must configure the suite to run it on Linux.</span>

## Requirements

- [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/).
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
- [Python v3](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Architecture

The diagram shows the architecture of the test suite. When the runner file starts, it requires a configuration file and gets a configuration for each level (subconfigs). The test suite sequentially runs all the test cases from level 1 to level 7 and to validate them, it uses the main ``test-configs/<cloud>/<image_type>-config-<cloud>.json`:

You can modify the configuration file to fit your requirements. Some of the essentials you can modify are:

- `throttle_rate`: the sleep time in milliseconds between each test case execution.
- `mocha_timeout`: the extended timeout in milliseconds for a Mocha test case. The default timeout for a Mocha test case is 2000ms. You can increase it by changing `mocha_timeout` in the `config.json` according to your response time for the test case.
- `log_level`: numeric value from 1 to 5:

   - 1 shows only error logs.
   - 2 shows error and warning logs.
   - 3 shows error, warning and information logs.
   - 4 shows error, warning, information and debug logs.
   - 5 shows error, warning, information debug and trace logs.

### Test levels

All test cases are in the **test-cases** folder. The test cases are divided into different levels of test. In each level, some categories run sequentially as defined in the configuration file `test-configs/<cloud>/<image_type>-config-<cloud>.json`. Next sections describe the test level categories in detail.

#### Level 1 (file system and specification tests)

To test all folders, files, binaries, hardware requirements and mounting of the partitions in the deviceOS. The tests are divided into three modules:

- **slashDirectory** for checking all files and folders required for deviceOS.
- **partition** for testing the mounting and size of different partitions.
- **Specification** for testing the hardware.

#### Level 2 (program tests)

To check the existence of the required programs on the gateway. The test cases are validated against the version number of each program. The validation information comes from the `test-configs/<cloud>/<image_type>-config-<cloud>.json` file.
- **program_and_service**


#### Level 3 (internet connectivity tests)

- **network_and_connectivity** To verify the gateway connectivity to the internet.


#### Level 4 (Smoke Tests)

This level test for all the smoke checks for GW for testing the basic functionality of the software. These tests are run first and if any of them fail, the program terminates and the software is declared unstable. The test moves on to the next category only when all smoke tests pass.

- **deviceJS_smoke**
- **edge_smoke**
- **kaas_smoke**


#### Level 5 (system and acceptance tests)

To evaluate the system's compliance with the business requirements and to verify the system meets the delivery criteria. It runs all processes one by one.
- **system_and_acceptance**

#### Level 6 (PT tests)

To test all protocol translators (PT).
- **VirtualdevicePT**

#### Level 7 (facade unit tests)

The tests are divided into three categories:

- **deviceJS_functional** - for isolating each unit of the system to identify, analyze and fix the defects.

## Run

When you have completed your configuration, start running your tests:

1. Log in to the gateway using serial or SSH and clone the project:

   ```sh
   $ git clone https://github.com/PelionIoT/pelion-edge-ready-test-suite.git
   ```

1. Checkout to the project, and use:

   ```sh
   $ npm install
   ```
    if `kubectl` is not installed then run (Use API key and Url of respective cloud on which you are testing the Gateway)
    ```sh
    $ ./scripts/install_kubectl.sh <api_url> <api_key>
    ```
1. Run the test suite:

   ```sh
   $ devicejs-run index.js -c test-configs/<cloud>/<image_type>-config-<cloud>.json
   ```
    or

    ```sh
    $ node index.js -c test-configs/<cloud>/<image_type>-config-<cloud>.json
    ```

## Report

The test suite generates a detailed report in JSON and HTML format. The report outlines the test cases run under each category and indicates whether they **PASSED** or **FAILED**. It also logs the execution time of each test case and shows the success rate with total time taken by the test suite. The output files can be found in **suite_reports** folder.

## Troubleshooting

If you get following python issue in npm install
```
gyp ERR! stack ImportError: No module named site
```
then run command
```sh
$ unset PYHTONHOME
$ unset PYTHONPATH
```

    represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
    of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
    separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
    the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

    "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
    the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
    to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
    submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
    or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
    the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
    means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
    to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
    communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
    and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
    Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
    excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
    designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

    "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
    on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
    subsequently incorporated within the Work.

 2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
    this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
    worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
    copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
    publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
    Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

 3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
    this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
    worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
    (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
    use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
    where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
    by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
    Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
    with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
    institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
    cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
    or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
    or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
    granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
    as of the date such litigation is filed.

 4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
    Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
    modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
    meet the following conditions:

    (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
        Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

    (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
        stating that You changed the files; and

    (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
        that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
        attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
        excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
        the Derivative Works; and

    (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
        distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
        include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
        within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
        pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
        of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
        as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
        documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
        within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
        wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
        of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
        do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
        notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
        or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
        that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
        as modifying the License.

    You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
    may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
    for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
    for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
    reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
    the conditions stated in this License.

 5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
    any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
    by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
    this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
    Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
    the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
    with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

 6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
    names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
    except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
    origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

 7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
    agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
    Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
    implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
    of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
    PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
    appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
    risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

 8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
    whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
    unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
    negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
    liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
    incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
    result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
    Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
    work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
    other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
    has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

 9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
    the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
    and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
    or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
    License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
    on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
    of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
    defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
    incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
    of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications

      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You

          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must

          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and

          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,

      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
